### User Personas




### User Stories




### Research, Inspiration, and Brainstorm

For my inspiration, I looked at coworking spaces and coffee shops around Portland. After looking at a lot of sites that seemed to fit with the look and feel that the client was trying to convey. With attention to images, margins, font, fluidity, color choices, and use of logos, I developed an idea for the overall look of the client's site.


### Technologies and Resources

* Sketch
* HTML
* CSS
* Sass

### Responsiveness

Webpages will read just nav bar display, image size, and main container layout as the viewport changes sizes. There are 3 main viewports in mind: mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Setup Instructions

* Download this repository at https://github.com/neliaterrazas/freelance-project.git
* $ npm install in the terminal to retrieve node_modules folder
* $ npm run build in the terminal to retrieve dist folder
* Open in your favorite text editor to see said folders
* $ npm run start to open a new tab with the live site/ compile code.


### Roadmap
I would like to continue building out the amenities and how to join pages for all versions, as all of my 4 remaining hours was spent on styling and building out the index page as planned out on my wireframe. The amenities page is where I plan to use grid to my full advantage, especially with media queries, to integrate all the icons I made on Sketch.
